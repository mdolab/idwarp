        CGNSFile: string -> file name of the CGNS file. This CGNS file should be generated with
        cgns_utils combine, so that the domain names have the appropriate convention. That is,
        domains will have the same name as their original files. Domains that share the same name
        will be grouped to make an IDWarp instance.

        optionsDict: dictionary of dictionaries -> Dictionary containing dictionaries that will
        be used to initialize multiple IDWarp instances. The keys are domain names and the
        values are dictionaries of standard IDWarp options that will be applied to this domain.
        The domains of the full CGNS file that do not have a corresponding entry in optionsDict will
        not be warped. For instance, if the CGNS file has the domains wing.00000, wing.00001, and wing.00002
        associated with a wing mesh that we want to warp, then optionsDict should have an entry for 'wing'.
