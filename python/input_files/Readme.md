# Input files used by regression tests and some examples have to be downloaded

The input files for test need to be downloaded.

From the command line, navigate to the `idwarp/python` directory and download and extract the archive

wget http://mdolab.engin.umich.edu/sites/default/files/mdolabwebsite/repos/idwarp/input_files.tar.gz
tar -xzvf input_files.tar.gz 

The above should extract the files to the `idwarp/python/input_files` directory.
